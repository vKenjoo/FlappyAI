AI Flappy Bird Game
This is my first time implementing neural networks using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) and AI. The project is an implementation of the Flappy Bird game using Python's Pygame library, enhanced with an AI that learns to play the game using the NEAT algorithm. 

Features
Classic Flappy Bird gameplay.
AI learns to play using NEAT.
Visual display of the NEAT algorithm in action.
Configurable game and NEAT parameters.
Requirements
Python 3.6+
Pygame
NEAT-Python
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vkenjo/FlappyAI.git
cd FlappyAI
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame neat-python
Usage
To start the game and watch the AI in action, run:

bash
Copy code
python flappy_bird.py
Configuration
The configuration for the NEAT algorithm can be found in the config-feedforward.txt file. To experiment with the AI's learning process, you can adjust parameters such as population size, mutation rates, and more.
