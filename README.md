#AI Flappy Bird Game
This project showcases an implementation of the Flappy Bird game using Python's Pygame library, enhanced with an AI that learns to play the game using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm.

Features
Classic Flappy Bird Gameplay: Enjoy the classic mechanics of the Flappy Bird game.
AI Learning with NEAT: Watch as the AI learns to play the game using the NEAT algorithm.
Visual Display: See the NEAT algorithm in action with visual representations.
Configurable Parameters: Adjust game and NEAT algorithm parameters to experiment with the AI's learning process.
Requirements
Python 3.6+
Pygame
NEAT-Python
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vkenjo/FlappyAI.git
cd FlappyAI
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame neat-python
Usage
To start the game and watch the AI in action, run:

bash
Copy code
python flappy_bird.py
Configuration
The configuration for the NEAT algorithm can be found in the config-feedforward.txt file. You can adjust parameters such as population size, mutation rates, and more to experiment with the AI's learning process.
